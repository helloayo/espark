Student will play an educational video about the 8 parts of speech and will be redirected to one of 3 evaluations that explore three hypothesis on student assesment styles. The responses and scores (when needed) are captured during the assesment. Click tracking is handled through Google Analytics and SeeVolution. Alternatively, student reactions, social cues, and body languge can also be observed through in room or video options. 

Results are compared by assesment time, tries, and scores.

##Hypothesis A: _Formative Assesments Through Gameplay_

 When used as formative assesments, games can evaluate critical thinking skils, retention of information, and student growth. Games can be used as a tool to support and supplement learning, and can be beeficial for low performing students by differentiating instruction.

 The games can be as simple as matching two concepts, or they can build upon popular concepts, such as a flappy bird like game that asseses a studen't understanding of prime numbers by letting students move up and down when prime numbers appear.


_Affordances: Trackpad, Mouse, Touchscreen_

Goal: Students should be able to identify the 8 parts of speech. 

The student will be presented with a simple drag and drop game, where they will fill in the blanks with the 8 parts of speech. This concept can be built upon with graphics and sound. For example,  student could be assesed on their understanding of planets in our solar system by dragging a planet to it's place in the solar system. 

* Response Capture  
  * Student will drag the part of speech to it's coresponding definition.   
  * Feedback will be immediate, with correct responses turning green.  
  * Assesment is complete once all words have been inputted.   


##Hypothesis B: _Multiple Choice With Feedback_

 Multiple choice is a tried and true, flexible form of assesment that can measure knowledge, skills, and abilities. In this assesment feedback is paired with each question, designed to deepen the understanding of the right answers and explain the worng answers. The feedback provides a way to reinforce concepts learned earlier.

Goal: Students should be able to identify the 8 parts of speech. 

The student will be presented with 8 multiple choice questions, with feedback for both right and wrong answers. Visually, students can see their progression and how well they did upon submitting. 

* Response Capture  
  * Student will select the correct part of speech.   
  * Feedback will be given upon submission, with correct responses in green, and incorrect responses in red.  
  * Assesment is complete upon submission.  


##Hypothesis C: _Voice and Text Input With Feedback_

Oral assesments are a traditional form of assesment that can be used as a fun way for kids to answer questions. As an alternative, students are given the opportnity to simply type in the answers. Feedback for both right and wrong answers are included. A more advanced version of this concept could include flexible questions with follow ups based on responses, and a way for students to ask more questions about the material.

Goal: Students should be able to identify the 8 parts of speech. 

The student will be presented with 8 definitions, with feedback for both right and wrong answers. Visually, students can see their progression and how well they did upon submitting. 

* Response Capture  
  * Student will speak or type the correct part of speech (needs to be in browser -> helloayo.com/espark/evalC.html)   
  * Feedback will be given upon submission, with correct responses in green, and incorrect responses in red.  
  * Assesment is complete upon submission.
